<h1>Haunted House</h1>

<h3>The Basement</h3>
<div>
  You walk down the steps of the staircase that lead into the basement. It is pitch black and you can't find the light. Suddenely, the door locks behind you.
</div>

<p>
  It looks like someone has locked you in here forever. You can scream and shout all you want, no one will hear you. Game over.
